                Hi, my name is Kyle Hoac and before enrolling at Code Fellows I was previously working in the sales industry. I've always wanted to learn how to write code as a kid, and in terms of a career, software development is one of the only fields that Iâ€™m genuinely interested in. Coming from the sales industry, I've had the pleasure of working with many different types of people coming from all different backgrounds, and I believe my previous experiences have only honed my ability to work with people individually, as well as work in a group environment. Some of my hobbies include music production, dominating opposing teams in video games, and traveling.

                Before enrolling in Code Fellows I spent the past decade in the insurance industry working for large insurers and brokers as well as a couple of insurance focused startups. I had been interested in learning to code for a number of years but was in a career that was tough to leave. As is the case with many people though 2020 was a year of reflection and changing priorities so I decided to go full steam ahead with software development. Once I finish Code Fellows I am hoping to use my newly acquired skills to make rad software - or maybe finance/insurance software - which is decidedly less rad - but still pretty awesome to me.
